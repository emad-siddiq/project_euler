# Solutions for Project Euler

These are my solutions for Project Euler, a series of challenging algorithmic problems. I chose C as the language to attempt these questions with maximal freedom. 

To compile and run a solution:

```
gcc -o bin/output_file_name problem_X.c
```
Then run with
```
./output_file_name
```
